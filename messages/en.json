It is ideal for a wide variety of use cases, such as cloud applications, dynamic websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics. With low latency and high throughput, S3 Standard is designed to provide 99.99% availability with a 99.9% SLA.",

        "standardIADescription": "The S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) class is recommended for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires quick access when needed. It offers the high levels of resilience and throughput and low latency of the S3 Standard class, with reduced rates per GB of storage and GB of recovery. It is ideal for long-term storage, backups, and data stores for disaster recovery files.",
        "intelligentTieringName": "Intelligent Tiering",
        "intelligentTieringDescription": "S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the first class of cloud storage that automatically reduces object-level storage costs by moving data to the most cost-effective access tier based on access frequency. With no impact on performance, recovery rates or operational overhead, it is ideal for data with unknown or variable access patterns. Delivers millisecond latency and high throughput performance for frequently accessed, infrequently and rarely accessed data at the Frequent Access, Infrequent Access and Archive Instant Access tiers.",

        "oneZoneIADescription": "S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA) is indicated for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires quick access when needed. Unlike other S3 storage classes, which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs), One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ, at a 20% lower cost than S3 Standard-IA. It's ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but who don't need the availability and resiliency of S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA.",

It's ideal for archiving data that needs immediate access, such as medical images, news media assets, or user-generated content files. Provides the fastest access to file storage, with the same throughput and millisecond access as S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes.",
        "glacierName": "Glacier Flexible Retrieval",
        "glacierDescription": "S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval provides low-cost storage for archival data that is accessed 1-2 times per year and retrieved asynchronously. It is ideal for backup or disaster recovery use cases, offering the flexibility to recover large data sets at no cost, with recovery times ranging from minutes to hours, and with free bulk recoveries. Designed to provide 99.999999999% (eleven nines) data durability and 99.99% availability.",
        "deepArchiveName": "Glacier Deep Archive",
        "deepArchiveDescription": "S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3's most affordable storage class, supporting long-term digital retention and preservation for data that can be accessed once or twice a year. It is ideal for customers who maintain datasets for 7-10 years or more to meet regulatory compliance requirements, especially in highly regulated industries such as financial services, healthcare, and public sectors. All objects stored in S3 Glacier Deep Archive are replicated and stored in at least three geographically distributed Availability Zones, protected by 99.999999999% resilience, and can be restored within 72 hours.",
